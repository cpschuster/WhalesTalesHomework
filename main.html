                        It is up to us to do something for the whales and the planet. A great deal of what is affecting
                        the orcas can be fixed if we are all willing to make some changes at our homes. Investigate
                        your ecological “foot print” by filling out the sheet below. Try your best and make changes
                        where you can. Record the results and return them to your teacher by the due date. Remember,
                        even a little change, when added to what everyone else is doing, can add up quickly.

                        <p>
                            Packaging alone makes up 64 million tons by weight or 33% of all of our garbage. Last year
                            alone King County residents threw away 4 pounds of trash per person each day! Recycling one
                            aluminum can saves enough electricity to power your television for 3 hours. That’s a lot of
                            hydroelectric power saved, which means more safe habitat for salmon and more food for
                            whales.

                            Organic food is produced using sustainable agricultural production practices. Not permitted
                            are most conventional pesticides; fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients, or sewage
                            sludge; bioengineering; or ionizing radiation. Organic meat, poultry eggs, and dairy
                            products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. The USDA
                            National Organic Program website has more information including inspection and
                            certification information

                    <p>
                        If every household in the US replaced just <strong>one</strong> 12 pack of virgin fiber
                        bathroom tissue with 100% recycled ones we could save 4.4 million trees and avoid 275,000
                        pounds of pollution! More trees means more habitat for salmon, which are orcas’ main food
                        source. Bleaching paper with chlorine compounds to make it whiter is one of the largest
                        causes of toxic pollution in Washington State. This toxic contaminant is called Dioxin and is
                        one of the most toxic chemicals known to man. Dioxin causes all sorts of immunological and
                        reproductive problems in mammals.
