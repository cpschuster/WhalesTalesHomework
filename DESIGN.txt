RECYCLING AT HOME
Fact: Recycling decreases emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change and conserves natural resources such as timber and water, protecting salmon!

1. Does your household currently recycle with a curbside recycling service and/or taking materials to a drop-off center?
- Yes
- No

LOGIC: If "Yes"
1a. What types of materials do you currently recycle at home?
- Paper / newspaper / cardboard
- Plastic
- Glass
- Aluminum
- Other Metal
- Other, Please describe (text box)

LOGIC: If "No"
1b. Would your family be willing to start recycling today?
- No
- Yes, we will try from now on

COMPOSTING: FOOD AND YARD WASTE
Fact: Organic waste from decomposing food and yard trimmings in landfills generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By composting wasted food and other organic materials our methane emissions are significantly reduced which can help preserve our  protective ozone layer and slow climate change.

2. Do you compost your food scraps and/or yard waste at home?
- Yes
- No

LOGIC: If "No"
2a. Would your family be willing to start composting today?
- No
- Yes, we will try from now on

ORGANIC FOOD = LESS POLLUTION
Fact: Organic food has been grown or processed without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, irradiation, industrial solvents, or chemical food additives. These additives and byproducts from traditional agriculture and production processes can enter our water systems and cause harmful algae blooms and pollution in the ocean. Eating foods and using products that are organic can reduce the amount of pollution entering our water supply and oceans, saving our salmon and orcas.

3. Do you use products and have food that has this symbol (The USDA Organic Label) on the packaging/label?
- Yes, every item in our house is organic
- Some things in our house are labeled organic
- No

LOGIC: If "No" or "Some things..."
3a. On your next shopping trip can your family replace at least one of your normal purchases with an organic product?
- No
- Yes, we will try to swap in the organic version from now on

NO STRAW, NO THANK YOU
Fact: 500 million straws are used and discarded every day in the United States alone. Plastics that end up as ocean debris contribute to habitat destruction and kill tens of thousands of marine animals each year.

4.  Will you commit to saying “no, thank you” to plastic straws the next time you are offered one?
- I never use plastic straws
- Yes, I will refuse the next plastic straw that I am offered
- I will refuse the plastic straw from now on
- No

UNDER INFLATED TIRES
Fact: When tires are not inflated to the correct Pounds per Square Inch (PSI), they are less “round”and require more energy to begin moving and to maintain speed. As such, under-inflated tires do contribute to unnecessary pollution and increased fuel costs.

5. Are the tires on your family motor vehicle(s) inflated to the correct PSI?
- Yes all tires already were properly inflated
- We had to inflate some or all of the tires to reach the correct PSI
- No and we did not correct the problem
- We do not have motor vehicles

RECYCLED AND CHLORINE FREE PAPER
Fact: If every household replaced one 12-pack of virgin fiber bathroom tissue with 100% recycled tissue we could save 4.4 million trees and avoid 275,000 pounds of pollution! More trees means more habitat for salmon!

6. Check the packaging on your paper products (paper towels, toilet paper, printer paper, school supplies, etc.). Do the say “chlorine free" and/or "made with post consumer” or have this symbol (recycled symbol) on the packaging/label?
- Yes, all of our paper products are recycled and/or chlorine free
- Some things  are recycled or chlorine free
- None of my paper products have these labels
- We do not use any paper products at home; we use washable rags for toilet paper and paper towels and do not print or draw on paper

LOGIC: If "Yes" or "Some things..."
6a. What paper goods did you find that are made chlorine free or from post consumer/recycled materials?
- Toilet paper
- Facial tissue / Kleenex
- Paper towels
- Printer Paper
- Notebook Paper
- Drawing paper
- Paper plates
- Paper napkins
- Wet wipes
- Other, Please describe (text box)


LOGIC: If "None" or "Some things..."
6b. On your next shopping trip can you replace at least one of your normal paper purchase with a chlorine-free/recycled product??
- Yes
- No

BE WHALE WISE
Fact: Seeing killer whales and other marine wildlife in their natural environment can be a thrilling experience. But sometimes we forget that our presence has an effect on wildlife. Just like us, marine animals need space to find food, choose mates, raise young, socialize, and rest. For more info go to www.bewhalewise.org

7. Will you commit to “Being Whale Wise” and stay at least 200 yards away from the whales?
- Yes, I will only watch whales from the beach
- Yes, if I am in a boat or kayak I will stay at least 200 yards away from the whales
- No

Questions 8 -10
I think for the most part, you and I have already established the logic for the water usage, thermometer entries, and energy efficient light bulbs so I won't give specifics on these questions again unless you need them.

What Else Do You Do? or... Jeff! How Did You Forget To Mention This?
Fact: People all over the world are making a difference everyday. You can too!
11. Please list one other thing, not mentioned above, that you and your family do to “reduce, reuse and recycle” and save the whales.  (big text box)

KIDS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Fact: If you tell three people something and they each share that information with three more people who each share it with three more people, who share that with three more people then 120 people will have learned something awesome from you! That's called the ripple effect.
12. Can you start making some ripples? Share what you learned today during Killer Whale Tales with your pod at home or after class. Ask them to pass along the information to more people. (Remember "Poop is scientifically important for Orca researchers!")
- OK
- No thanks

LOGIC: If "OK"
Who did you share your orca knowledge with? Your mom? Your grandma? A few friends? (text box)

LOGIC: If "No Thanks"
Why do you want to keep this information to yourself? (text box)
